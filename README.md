<!--Introduction -->
I've created this repo to automatize new release builds from [pjsip](https://github.com/pjsip).
The goal was automatize the build for Android,, iOS, OSX, Linux and Windows platforms, also compile external dependencies with each build.
The future plans is upgrade the xamarin solution provided by pjsip to an MAUI app.
